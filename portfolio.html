      <h3>Contextual Inquiry: Ann Arbor SPARK Online Job Portal</h3>
      <img class = "photo" src="img/501.JPG" alt="Affinity Wall for SI 501 Contextual Inquiry" style="width:100%">

        <p class = "description" >As a part of SI 501 at the University of Michigan, I participated in a thorough analysis, interpretation, and made recommendations to improve a job portal owned by local nonprofit Ann Arbor SPARK. By conducting in-person interviews, our team gathered information about the use and perception of the job portal from local employers, job-seekers, and employees of SPARK. We organized the information gleaned from these interviews into an affinity wall and used this wall to form the basis of our recommendations.

            <h3>Facebook/iTunes API Search</h3>
    <img class = "photo" src="img/facebookproject.png" alt="Facebook and iTunes API search program" style="width:100%">

        <p class = "description">This program was created to search through the 50 most recent posts on a user’s Facebook timeline and find the most common word amongst all the posts that is not a stopword (i.e. “a", "the”, “we”). After the most common word is found, the application will then search the iTunes API using this word. After searching the API and caching the data received from the site, the program will organize the search results to sort the songs returned by song length and finally write the list of songs into a CSV file.</p>

            <h3>Dynamic Web Application - PHP and MySQL</h3>
    <img class = "photo" src="img/crudcopy.png" alt="Cread Read Update and Delete diagram for database program" style="width:100%">

      <p class = "description">Designed and constructed a full stack dynamic web application using PHP and MySQL as well as HTML and CSS. Created three related SQL tables and a user interface so users can create, read, update, and delete records as well as link tables together. Created and implemented a working API to display records in real time. Used session control for login/logout functionality.
<br><br>
The web application links 3 tables together: customers, events, and assignments. Assignments act as the associative table for the application and can link customers and events together. The application is live and working, just click the Join (New User) button and create a profile

    <img class = "photo" src="img/solarsystemgif.gif" alt="CSS and HTML diagram of the solar system" style="width:100%">

      <p class = "description">This is a recreation of the solar system only using CSS. This project was used as an introduction to cascading stylesheets and was created to test my abilities in manipulating objects on a webspace. The planets all rotate around the sun relative to their actual orbit times. In this animation, 10 seconds is equal to one orbit of Earth around the sun.

  <img class = "photo" src="img/azlyrics.png" alt="Screenshot from AZLyrics.com" style="width:100%">

    <p class = "description">I am developing a python program that asks the user to input 10 different songs and artists and then scrape song lyrics from the website https://www.azlyrics.com/ and finds the 10 most common words from each song. Then, for each of these words, the program searches the Open Movie Database API and retrieve the first search result of each search term. Finally, the program uses Plotly to graph information related to all 100 movies including: country, box office earnings, IMDB score, and genre.</p></div>

    <p class = "description">As part of a class for SI 622: Needs Assessment and Usability Evaluation, I am participating in an in-depth evaluation of the usability, usefulness, and acceptability of the interactive team formation software My Dream Team, currently being developed by a team of researchers at Northwestern University.

  <img class = "photo" src="img/PickMeUp.png" alt="Screenshot from interactive prototype of Pick Me Up mobile applicaiton" style="width:100%">

    <p class = "description">As a part of my SI 582 class, I created a high-fidelity prototype of an application called “Pick Me Up” to assist users with finding games of pickup basketball in their local communities. I designed this application to allow users to search for games happening in their area based on their GPS location, join games on the application to reserve their spot, and message friends on the application in order to coordinate and plan their games.
