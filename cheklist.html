Below that featured events are displayed in a rolling list with images. There is no discernable differences between the first two types of information and why events and feautred events are different. Additionally, the images for the featured events are too distorted from zooming in, making it difficult to see the images.</td>

  <h2>Recommendations</h2>
  <p> 1. Change hover attributes and style of navigation bar submenu options and quick links to include some sort of additional visual cue besides color change to represent that the element leads to another page. Add an underline or create an animation of the text moving to represent some visual difference between the link from plain text.</p>
  <p> 2. Include a dropdown menu or extra descriptive text to each option on the transportation links page to offer more insights about what each link leads to</p>
  <p> 3. Add submenu navbar options to the tabindex to allow for navigation using keyboard.</p>
  <p> 4. Change layout and design of information links on the main page to be more distinct. Style all options in a grid format with a thumbnail picture to keep consistent and make sure people don't gloss over the quicklinks</p>
