<h2 class ="title" style="text-align:center">Fishing</h2>
<p>I have always been an avid fishermen and definitely enjoy a morning on the boat. Walleye fishing with my dad on Lake St. Clair is by far my favorite type of fishing, but I enjoy many other types of recreational fishing. Some memorable trips I have taken over the years include sturgeon fishing in the Detroit River and fishing for walleye and bass on Mullet Lake.</p>

<h2 class ="title" style="text-align:center">Lacrosse</h2>
<p>I have been playing lacrosse for over 10 years. In college, I was a member of the Saginaw Valley Men's Club Lacrosse Team. In high school, I played on the varsity team for 4 years at Heritage High School and played travel lacrosse as part of the Grand Blanc Lacrosse Coalition. I have always loved the sport of lacrosse and I am thrilled to see the sport growing so rapidly.<p>

<h2 class ="title" style="text-align:center">Travel</h2>
<p>I enjoy traveling and going backpacking in my spare time. In July of 2017, I took a two week backpacking trip to Peru in order to explore the Amazon Rainforest and visit the ruins of the Incan city of Machu Picchu. I had an amazing time exploring Peru and I would love the chance to go back someday.</p>
